I made an insert for a regular 32mm strip feeder. In my case I needed a way to easily handle small amounts of TSOP-56 ICâ€™s (roughly 20mm x 14mm) which where provided to me in a big industrial tray. 

The current version is still far from perfect, but works relatively good if the strip feeder in OpenPNP is configured to use a tape width of 27 mm and a part pitch of 16 mm.
